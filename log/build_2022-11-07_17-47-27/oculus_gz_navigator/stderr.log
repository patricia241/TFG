[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo_classic.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gazebo_classic", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_classic"
  with any of the following names:

    gazebo_classicConfig.cmake
    gazebo_classic-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_classic" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_classic_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_classic" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
